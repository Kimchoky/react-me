They are a powerful way to handle asynchronous code in a more synchronous fashion.</p><p>Promises have three states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected. They provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks.</p><p>Using promises, developers can chain multiple asynchronous operations and handle errors more effectively.</p><p>Promises can be created using the Promise constructor, which takes an executor function as an argument.</p><p>The executor function receives two arguments: resolve and reject, which are used to settle the promise.</p><p>Promises can be consumed using the then and catch methods, which allow for chaining and error handling.</p><p>Async/await syntax provides a more readable and concise way to work with promises.</p><p>Understanding promises is essential for working with modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries.</p>",
